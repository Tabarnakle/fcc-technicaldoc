                    <p>The 2021 BJCP Style Guidelines are a minor revision to the 2015 edition, itself a major update of
                        the 2008 edition. The goals of the 2015 edition were to better address world beer styles as
                        found in their local markets, keep pace with emerging craft beer market trends, describe
                        historical beers now finding a following, better describe the sensory characteristics of modern
                        brewing ingredients, take advantage of new research and references, and help competition
                        organizers better manage the complexity of their events. These goals have not changed in the
                        2021 edition.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, many styles were added, some styles were divided into multiple categories, and some
                        simply renamed. Styles are organized into categories following a philosophy that groups styles
                        with similar judging characteristics rather than a common heritage or family name. Do not assume
                        that the same primary characteristic (e.g., color, strength, balance, dominant flavor, country
                        of origin) was used to determine each category grouping - the reasoning was more nuanced. If you
                        are familiar with the 2015 guidelines, we have made a few name changes and some styles have
                        moved from provisional, historical, or local styles into the main guidelines. We intentionally
                        tried to keep style moves, style additions, and numbering changes to a minimum.</p>

                        <h2>STYLES AND CATEGORIES</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>The BJCP Style Guidelines use some specific terms with
                        specialized meanings: Category, Subcategory, and Style.
                        When thinking of beer, mead, and cider styles, the
                        subcategory is the most important label - subcategory
                        means essentially the same thing as style and identifies
                        the major characteristics of one type of beer, mead, or
                        cider. Each style has a well-defined description that is the
                        basic tool used during judging.
                        When specialty beer descriptions refer to a Classic Style,
                        we mean a named style (or subcategory name) in the
                        BJCP Style Guidelines prior to the Specialty-Type Beer
                        styles section.</p>
                    <p>The larger categories are arbitrary groupings of beer,
                        mead, or cider styles, usually with similar sensory
                        characteristics. Subcategories are not necessarily related
                        to each other within the same category. The purpose of the
                        category structure is to group styles of beer, mead, and
                        cider to facilitate judging during competitions. Do not
                        attempt to derive additional meaning from these
                        groupings - no historical or geographic association is
                        implied or intended.</p>
                    <p>Competitions may create their own award categories that
                        are distinct from the style categories in these guidelines.
                        There is no requirement that competitions use
                        style categories as award categories! Individual
                        styles can be grouped in any manner to create desired
                        award categories in competition; for instance, to evenly
                        distribute the number of entries in each award category.
                        While style categories are more useful for judging
                        purposes since they group beers with similar sensory
                        characteristics, we recognize this may not be the best way
                        to learn about beer styles. For educational purposes, the
                        styles may be grouped into style families so they may be
                        compared and contrasted. Beers may also be grouped by
                        country of origin to better understand the history of beer
                        in a country, or to learn about a local market. Any of these
                        groupings is perfectly acceptable; the styles have only been
                        grouped as they are to facilitate competition judging. See
                        Appendix A for alternative groupings of styles.</p>

                        <h2>NAMING OF STYLES AND CATEGORIES</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>We chose names and titles to best represent the styles and
                        groupings in our categorization system. Don't let these
                        names interfere with your understanding the actual style
                        descriptions - that is the main point of the BJCP Style
                        Guidelines. We are not telling breweries what they should
                        call their products. We are only providing names that can
                        be used for easy reference. </p>
                    <p>We realize that many of our defined styles can have
                        alternate names, or are called different things in other (or
                        even the same) parts of the world. In the past, we used
                        multiple names in style titles to avoid showing preference,
                        but this too often led people to incorrectly use all those
                        names simultaneously. So, we selected one unambiguous
                        name for each style.</p>
                    <p>We added a country or region of origin to some style titles
                        in order to differentiate between styles using a common
                        name (such as Porter). The titles we selected are intended
                        to be both unique and descriptive, but are not necessarily
                        what the products are called in local markets. We are not
                        implying any special ownership or standing based on the
                        names we selected, and we apologize for any unintentional
                        political, ethnic, or social offenses.</p>
                    <p>Some names we use are protected appellations or
                        trademarks. We are not saying that these should not be
                        respected, or that commercial breweries can use these
                        names. Rather, these are the most appropriate names to
                        use when discussing the styles. If this concept is hard to
                        understand, just assume there is an implied “-style”
                        designation on every style name. We didn't want to use
                        “-style” in our naming scheme since these are style
                        guidelines, and of course everything is a style.</p>

                        <h2>USING</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>When we published previous versions of the style
                        guidelines, we had no idea how prevalent and pervasive
                        they would become. We believed we were creating a
                        standardized set of style descriptions for use in homebrew
                        competitions, but then found they were widely adopted
                        worldwide to describe beer in general. Many countries
                        with emerging craft beer markets are now using them as
                        handbooks for what to brew. Consumers and trade groups
                        began using the styles to describe their products. And
                        unfortunately, many made astounding leaps of logic well
                        beyond our original intent, and subsequently used the
                        guidelines as a sort of universal Rosetta Stone for beer.</p>
                    <p>While we understand that our guidelines may have been
                        misused in contexts beyond our original intent, we've also
                        observed them being misused in competitions and for
                        other BJCP purposes such as exam preparation and
                        grading. Some people misinterpret the guidelines, and
                        then often unknowingly instruct others in their misuse.
                        Our hope is that the information in this section will help
                        prevent many cases of misinterpretation and misuse in the
                        future. If anyone encounters someone using the guidelines
                        incorrectly, please refer them to this section.
                        The following maxims express our original intent, and are
                        designed to limit misuse, not to prevent the guidelines
                        from being adopted for new uses:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>The BJCP Style Guidelines are guidelines not
                            specifications. Take those words at face value, or
                            their plain meaning. Guidelines are meant to
                            describe general characteristics of the most common
                            examples, and serve as an aid for judging; they are
                            not meant to be rigorously-applied specifications
                            that are used to punish slightly unusual examples.
                            They are suggestions, not hard limits. Allow for
                            some flexibility in judging so that well-crafted
                            examples can be rewarded. The guidelines are
                            written in detail to facilitate the process of the
                            structured evaluation of beer as practiced in
                            homebrewing competitions; don't use each
                            individual statement in style descriptions as a
                            reason to disqualify a beer.</p></li>

                        <li>The Style Guidelines are written primarily
                            for homebrew competitions. Individual style
                            descriptions are written primarily to aid in judging.
                            We have, in some cases, sought to define clear lines
                            between styles to create non-overlapping judging
                            categories. We understand that some styles may
                            overlap in the market, and some commercial
                            examples may straddle boundaries. We have
                            organized style categories for the purpose of
                            organizing homebrew competitions, not for
                            describing and communicating the styles of the
                            world to a different audience.</li>

                        <li>We know many people use our guidelines.
                            We understand that other organizations or groups
                            are using our guidelines for purposes well beyond
                            our original intent. To the extent that those groups
                            find value in our work, we are happy to have our
                            guidelines used. We freely allow our naming and
                            numbering system to be used by others. However,
                            don't make rash assumptions about the nature of
                            beer and beer styles based on applications of the
                            guidelines beyond their original intent. We also
                            know some craft brewers are using our guidelines to
                            rediscover historical styles, or to brew styles not
                            native to their country - we are thrilled to be able to
                            help advance craft beer in this way. Just remember
                            that it's not our original mission to do this; it's just a
                            happy side-effect.</li>

                        <li>Styles change over time. Beer styles change over
                            the years, and some styles are open to interpretation
                            and debate. Simply because a style name hasn't
                            changed over the years, doesn't mean that the beers
                            themselves haven't also changed. Commercial
                            brewers subject to government regulation and
                            market forces definitely change their products over
                            time. For example, because there is now a beer
                            known as porter doesn't mean that it has always
                            been made that way throughout its history. Our beer
                            styles are generally meant to describe modern beers

                        <li>Not every commercial beer fits our styles.
                            Don't assume that every beer fits neatly into one of
                            our categories. Some breweries revel in creating
                            examples that don't match our (or anyone else's)
                            guidelines. Some create beer called by a style name
                            that deliberately doesn't match our guidelines. It's
                            perfectly fine for a commercial beer to not match
                            one of our styles; we have not attempted to
                            categorize every commercial beer - that is neither
                            our intent nor our mission.</li>

                        <li>We have not defined every possible beer
                            style. Of course we know of beer styles that aren't
                            defined in our guidelines. Perhaps they are obscure
                            or unpopular, homebrewers aren't making the
                            styles, insufficient examples or research material
                            exists to adequately define them to our standards, or
                            they are from a part of the world we haven't visited
                            extensively. Maybe they are historical styles no
                            longer made, or that we believe the styles are a
                            passing fad. Regardless of our reasons, don't believe
                            that our guidelines represent the complete
                            categorization of every beer style ever made - they
                            aren't. They do, however, describe the beers most
                            commonly made today by homebrewers and many
                            craft breweries. </li>

                        <li>Commercial examples change over time. Just
                            like beer styles change, individual examples change
                            as well. A beer that was once a great example of a
                            style might not always remain so. Sometimes the
                            beer changes (with ownership change, perhaps) or
                            sometimes the style trend changes but the beer
                            doesn't. For example, Anchor Liberty helped define
                            the American IPA style when it was created, but it
                            seems much more like typical American Pale Ales
                            today. </li>

                        <li>Ingredients change over time. Hops are a good
                            example today; new varieties are coming to market
                            with unique characteristics. Brewers looking for a
                            vi BJCP Beer Style Guidelines - 2021 Edition
                            differentiator may be rapidly adopting (and
                            abandoning) ingredients. It is difficult to say that
                            the profile of a beer style is fixed when its typical
                            ingredients are changing constantly. Allow for these
                            changes when judging beer. For example, not all
                            American hops will be citrusy or piney. Don't be
                            rigid about judging based on what was commonly
                            used at the time of this writing; understand what
                            ingredients are typically used, and adapt judging to
                            match the evolving character.</li>

                        <li>Most styles are fairly broad. Some believe that
                            our styles inhibit brewer creativity by rigidly setting
                            boundaries. That is not our intent - we think
                            creativity drives innovation, and that interpretation
                            by brewers should be allowed. However, not every
                            innovation is a good idea, or results in a beer that is
                            recognizable in the same grouping of others with the
                            same name. Therefore, styles should be interpreted
                            as having some flexibility, but within reason.</li>

                        <li> The Style Guidelines are not the Ten
                            Commandments. The words in this document are
                            not due to divine inspiration - they were written by
                            people making a good faith effort to describe beer as
                            it is perceived. Don't treat them as some kind of
                            Holy Scripture. Don't get so lost in parsing
                            individual words that you lose sight of the overall
                            intent. The most important part of any style is the
                            overall balance and impression; that is, that the beer
                            reminds you of the style, and is a nicely drinkable
                            product. To get lost in the individual descriptions
                            loses the essence of the style. The mere fact that
                            style descriptions can change from one edition of
                            the guidelines to the next should be the clearest
                            illustration that the words themselves are not
                            sacred.</li>
