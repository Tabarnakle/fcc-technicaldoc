# BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition
# INTRODUCTION TO THE 2021 GUIDELINES
The 2021 BJCP Style Guidelines are a minor revision to the 2015 edition, itself a major update of the 2008 edition. The goals of the 2015 edition were to better address world beer styles as found in their local markets, keep pace with emerging craft beer market trends, describe historical beers now finding a following, better describe the sensory characteristics of modern brewing ingredients, take advantage of new research and references, and help competition organizers better manage the complexity of their events. These goals have not changed in the 2021 edition.
In 2015, many styles were added, some styles were divided into multiple categories, and some simply renamed. Styles are organized into categories following a philosophy that groups styles with similar judging characteristics rather than a common heritage or family name. Do not assume that the same primary characteristic (e.g., color, strength, balance, dominant flavor, country of origin) was used to determine each category grouping – the reasoning was more nuanced. If you are familiar with the 2015 guidelines, we have made a few name changes and some styles have moved from provisional, historical, or local styles into the main guidelines. We intentionally tried to keep style moves, style additions, and numbering changes to a minimum.
## Styles and Categories
The BJCP Style Guidelines use some specific terms with
specialized meanings: Category, Subcategory, and Style.
When thinking of beer, mead, and cider styles, the
subcategory is the most important label – subcategory
means essentially the same thing as style and identifies
the major characteristics of one type of beer, mead, or
cider. Each style has a well-defined description that is the
basic tool used during judging.
When specialty beer descriptions refer to a Classic Style,
we mean a named style (or subcategory name) in the
BJCP Style Guidelines prior to the Specialty-Type Beer
styles section.
The larger categories are arbitrary groupings of beer,
mead, or cider styles, usually with similar sensory
characteristics. Subcategories are not necessarily related
to each other within the same category. The purpose of the
category structure is to group styles of beer, mead, and
cider to facilitate judging during competitions. Do not
attempt to derive additional meaning from these
groupings – no historical or geographic association is
implied or intended.
Competitions may create their own award categories that
are distinct from the style categories in these guidelines.
There is no requirement that competitions use
style categories as award categories! Individual
styles can be grouped in any manner to create desired
award categories in competition; for instance, to evenly
distribute the number of entries in each award category.
While style categories are more useful for judging
purposes since they group beers with similar sensory
characteristics, we recognize this may not be the best way
to learn about beer styles. For educational purposes, the
styles may be grouped into style families so they may be
compared and contrasted. Beers may also be grouped by
country of origin to better understand the history of beer
in a country, or to learn about a local market. Any of these
groupings is perfectly acceptable; the styles have only been
grouped as they are to facilitate competition judging. See
Appendix A for alternative groupings of styles.

## Naming of Styles and Categories
We chose names and titles to best represent the styles and
groupings in our categorization system. Don’t let these
names interfere with your understanding the actual style
descriptions – that is the main point of the BJCP Style
Guidelines. We are not telling breweries what they should
call their products. We are only providing names that can
be used for easy reference.
We realize that many of our defined styles can have
alternate names, or are called different things in other (or
even the same) parts of the world. In the past, we used
multiple names in style titles to avoid showing preference,
but this too often led people to incorrectly use all those
names simultaneously. So, we selected one unambiguous
name for each style.
We added a country or region of origin to some style titles
in order to differentiate between styles using a common
name (such as Porter). The titles we selected are intended
to be both unique and descriptive, but are not necessarily
what the products are called in local markets. We are not
implying any special ownership or standing based on the
names we selected, and we apologize for any unintentional
political, ethnic, or social offenses.
Some names we use are protected appellations or
trademarks. We are not saying that these should not be
respected, or that commercial breweries can use these
names. Rather, these are the most appropriate names to
use when discussing the styles. If this concept is hard to
understand, just assume there is an implied “-style”
designation on every style name. We didn’t want to use
“-style” in our naming scheme since these are style
guidelines, and of course everything is a style.

## Using the Style Guidelines
When we published previous versions of the style
guidelines, we had no idea how prevalent and pervasive
they would become. We believed we were creating a
standardized set of style descriptions for use in homebrew
competitions, but then found they were widely adopted
BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition v
worldwide to describe beer in general. Many countries
with emerging craft beer markets are now using them as
handbooks for what to brew. Consumers and trade groups
began using the styles to describe their products. And
unfortunately, many made astounding leaps of logic well
beyond our original intent, and subsequently used the
guidelines as a sort of universal Rosetta Stone for beer.
While we understand that our guidelines may have been
misused in contexts beyond our original intent, we’ve also
observed them being misused in competitions and for
other BJCP purposes such as exam preparation and
grading. Some people misinterpret the guidelines, and
then often unknowingly instruct others in their misuse.
Our hope is that the information in this section will help
prevent many cases of misinterpretation and misuse in the
future. If anyone encounters someone using the guidelines
incorrectly, please refer them to this section.
The following maxims express our original intent, and are
designed to limit misuse, not to prevent the guidelines
from being adopted for new uses:

1. The BJCP Style Guidelines are guidelines not
specifications. Take those words at face value, or
their plain meaning. Guidelines are meant to
describe general characteristics of the most common
examples, and serve as an aid for judging; they are
not meant to be rigorously-applied specifications
that are used to punish slightly unusual examples.
They are suggestions, not hard limits. Allow for
some flexibility in judging so that well-crafted
examples can be rewarded. The guidelines are
written in detail to facilitate the process of the
structured evaluation of beer as practiced in
homebrewing competitions; don’t use each
individual statement in style descriptions as a
reason to disqualify a beer.

2. The Style Guidelines are written primarily
for homebrew competitions. Individual style
descriptions are written primarily to aid in judging.
We have, in some cases, sought to define clear lines
between styles to create non-overlapping judging
categories. We understand that some styles may
overlap in the market, and some commercial
examples may straddle boundaries. We have
organized style categories for the purpose of
organizing homebrew competitions, not for
describing and communicating the styles of the
world to a different audience.

3. We know many people use our guidelines.
We understand that other organizations or groups
are using our guidelines for purposes well beyond
our original intent. To the extent that those groups
find value in our work, we are happy to have our
guidelines used. We freely allow our naming and
numbering system to be used by others. However,
don’t make rash assumptions about the nature of
beer and beer styles based on applications of the
guidelines beyond their original intent. We also
know some craft brewers are using our guidelines to
rediscover historical styles, or to brew styles not
native to their country – we are thrilled to be able to
help advance craft beer in this way. Just remember
that it’s not our original mission to do this; it’s just a
happy side-effect.

4. Styles change over time. Beer styles change over
the years, and some styles are open to interpretation
and debate. Simply because a style name hasn’t
changed over the years, doesn’t mean that the beers
themselves haven’t also changed. Commercial
brewers subject to government regulation and
market forces definitely change their products over
time. For example, because there is now a beer
known as porter doesn’t mean that it has always
been made that way throughout its history. Our beer
styles are generally meant to describe modern beers
currently available, unless otherwise specified (e.g.,
in the Historical Beer category).

5. Not every commercial beer fits our styles.
Don’t assume that every beer fits neatly into one of
our categories. Some breweries revel in creating
examples that don’t match our (or anyone else’s)
guidelines. Some create beer called by a style name
that deliberately doesn’t match our guidelines. It’s
perfectly fine for a commercial beer to not match
one of our styles; we have not attempted to
categorize every commercial beer – that is neither
our intent nor our mission.

6. We have not defined every possible beer
style. Of course we know of beer styles that aren’t
defined in our guidelines. Perhaps they are obscure
or unpopular, homebrewers aren’t making the
styles, insufficient examples or research material
exists to adequately define them to our standards, or
they are from a part of the world we haven’t visited
extensively. Maybe they are historical styles no
longer made, or that we believe the styles are a
passing fad. Regardless of our reasons, don’t believe
that our guidelines represent the complete
categorization of every beer style ever made – they
aren’t. They do, however, describe the beers most
commonly made today by homebrewers and many
craft breweries.

7. Commercial examples change over time. Just
like beer styles change, individual examples change
as well. A beer that was once a great example of a
style might not always remain so. Sometimes the
beer changes (with ownership change, perhaps) or
sometimes the style trend changes but the beer
doesn’t. For example, Anchor Liberty helped define
the American IPA style when it was created, but it
seems much more like typical American Pale Ales
today.

8. Ingredients change over time. Hops are a good
example today; new varieties are coming to market
with unique characteristics. Brewers looking for a
vi BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition
differentiator may be rapidly adopting (and
abandoning) ingredients. It is difficult to say that
the profile of a beer style is fixed when its typical
ingredients are changing constantly. Allow for these
changes when judging beer. For example, not all
American hops will be citrusy or piney. Don’t be
rigid about judging based on what was commonly
used at the time of this writing; understand what
ingredients are typically used, and adapt judging to
match the evolving character.

9. Most styles are fairly broad. Some believe that
our styles inhibit brewer creativity by rigidly setting
boundaries. That is not our intent – we think
creativity drives innovation, and that interpretation
by brewers should be allowed. However, not every
innovation is a good idea, or results in a beer that is
recognizable in the same grouping of others with the
same name. Therefore, styles should be interpreted
as having some flexibility, but within reason.

10. The Style Guidelines are not the Ten
Commandments. The words in this document are
not due to divine inspiration – they were written by
people making a good faith effort to describe beer as
it is perceived. Don’t treat them as some kind of
Holy Scripture. Don’t get so lost in parsing
individual words that you lose sight of the overall
intent. The most important part of any style is the
overall balance and impression; that is, that the beer
reminds you of the style, and is a nicely drinkable
product. To get lost in the individual descriptions
loses the essence of the style. The mere fact that
style descriptions can change from one edition of
the guidelines to the next should be the clearest
illustration that the words themselves are not
sacred.

11. Our Guidelines are extensible. We understand
that our guidelines will change in the future, and
that there may be years between revision cycles. The
BJCP’s primary mission is to conduct exams, and if
the references changed constantly, it would make
studying nearly impossible. So, we have adopted a
compromise: we have Provisional Styles listed on
our website that can be used in the same way as
styles in these guidelines. This allows us to add
changes between editions. We also have a list of
Style Entry Suggestions on our website to help
understand where best to enter styles not defined in
the guidelines or as a Provisional Style. These
features, as well as the extensibility of some styles
such as Specialty IPA and Historical Beer, allow
brewer-defined styles to be used in competitions.
Combined, these three features allow the guidelines
to evolve between major updates.

12. We are not the beer police. We categorize and
describe beer styles that we see exist, and that are
used. In no way are we telling commercial brewers
what they can brew, or saying that they are wrong if
their products don’t fit our guidelines. We also do
not create styles in the hopes that they will become
popular. The state of the overall beer market in any
given country is not our concern.

13. Different formats exist. Our guidelines appear in
many third-party locations, on multiple mobile
platforms, and are translated into other languages.
Unfortunately, not all these versions contain the full
text of our guidelines, or are completely accurate
translations. Be careful when using a format
supplied by someone other than the BJCP; when in
doubt, always refer to the original source.

14. The BJCP does not run competitions.
Sometimes competitions use entry software that
limits comments, or otherwise makes it difficult to
comply with Entry Instructions in the guidelines.
Report problems to competition organizers and to
the software suppliers. Our intent is that all
allowable information requested by the guidelines
be supplied by brewers, be accepted by
competitions, and be furnished to judges.

## Format of a Style Description
We use a standard format for describing beer styles. The
sections within this template have specific meanings that
should be understood so as not to be misused:
- ### Overall Impression. This section describes the
essence of the style – those points that distinguish
it from other styles, and that make it unique. It
can also be thought of as an expanded consumer-
level description useful for describing and
differentiating the style to someone who isn’t a
beer geek or judge. This section also acknowledges
the many uses outside judging, and allows others
to describe a beer simply without using the detail
needed by judges.
- ### Appearance, Aroma, Flavor, Mouthfeel.
These four sections are the basic sensory building
blocks defining the style, and are the standards
against which a beer is judged in competition.
These sections focus on the sensory perceptions
derived from the ingredients, not the ingredients
or process themselves. For example, saying that a
Munich Helles tastes like continental Pils malt is a
great shorthand for what is perceived; except, of
course, if you have no idea what continental Pils
malt actually tastes like. Our guidelines are
written so that a trained judge who has not tasted
examples of a given style can do a credible job
judging it using the structured evaluation method
and using our guidelines as a reference.
- ### Comments. This section contains interesting
trivia or additional notes about a style that do not
affect the sensory assessment. Not every style has
extensive comments; some are quite simple.
- ### History. The BJCP is not a historical research
organization. We rely on available information,
BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition vii
often revising our summaries as new facts are
published. Our histories are abridged summaries
of some of the more important points of style
development; please do not take these notes as the
entire, complete history of styles.
- ### Characteristic Ingredients. We identify typical
or common ingredients or processes that drive the
distinguishing character of the style. Please do not
treat these notes as recipes, or as requirements.
Beer can be made in many different ways.
- ### Style Comparison. Since some might better
understand an unfamiliar style if it could be
described in terms of other known styles, we have
provided notes on the key points that distinguish a
style from similar or related styles. Not every
possible style comparison is listed.
• Entry Instructions. This section identifies the
required information necessary for judges to
evaluate a competition entry. This information
should always be provided by the entrant,
accepted by competition software, and provided to
judges. Entrants should be able to supply optional
comments about their entries, subject to review by
competition organizers.
• Vital Statistics. The general characteristics of
the style, expressed in Original Gravity (OG),
Final Gravity (FG), Alcohol-by-Volume (ABV),
International Bittering Units (IBUs), and Color as
expressed in the Standard Reference Method
(SRM) from the American Society of Brewing
Chemists (ASBC).
For those outside the United States that use the
European Brewing Convention (EBC) color
method, note that an EBC value is roughly double
the equivalent SRM value. For those familiar with
the Lovibond system, Lovibond is roughly
equivalent to SRM for colors that exist in all but
the darkest beers. For the purists out there, we’re
talking about what is distinguishable to a judge
using their eyes, not chemists using analytical
equipment in a laboratory setting.
Some style categories include multiple styles that
represent a continuum, such as British Bitter or
Scottish Ale. When we provide a dividing line
between these styles, we typically use a single
number to represent the upper bound of one style
and the lower bound of the next. This does not
imply that a beer with that borderline stat (e.g.,
ABV or OG) should be entered in both styles. No
overlap is intended. In these cases, treat the upper
bound as “ending just before” and the lower
bound as “starting at” the listed numbers.
Keep in mind that these Vital Statistics are still
guidelines, not absolutes. Commercial outliers
certainly exist, but these statistics are meant to
describe where most examples are clustered. They
help judges determine judging order, not whether
an example should be disqualified.
• Commercial Examples. We include a selection
of current commercial examples that we believe
are representative of the style at the time of
publication. We may publish additional examples
on the BJCP website in the future. We cannot
guarantee that breweries will continue to make
these examples, that the names will stay the same,
that the recipes won’t change, or that they will be
available at your local bottle shop. Some are
rotating, seasonal, pub-only, or otherwise difficult
to find outside festivals, competitions, or local
markets.
Do not assign any additional meaning to the order
of examples within the guidelines. Do not assume
that every commercial example would score
perfectly when evaluated against the style
descriptions. Simply because a commercial
example is listed as a reference for a style does not
mean that every example is going to be world-
class. Some beers can be mishandled, and some
examples change over time.
Do not use commercial examples as the sole
benchmark for a style – judge competition beers
against the guidelines, not expectations from a
single commercial example. One beer rarely
defines the entire range of a style, so do not limit
your expectations in such a restrictive way.
Breweries often assign names to their beers that
do not agree with our style guidelines. Be careful
about selecting examples based on brewery-
supplied names alone.
• Tags. To facilitate the sorting of styles into
alternate groupings, we have applied tags to
signify attributes or information about a style. The
tags are in no particular order, and should not be
used to infer any deeper meaning.
Style Description Language
The guidelines are a set of long documents, and some style
descriptions are quite involved. To keep the prose from
being bone-dry boring, synonyms (words or phrases
meaning exactly the same thing, or having nearly the same
meaning) are frequently used. Do not attempt to read
more into the use of synonyms than is intended. In the
past, some have questioned the difference between light
and low, medium and moderate, deep and dark, and
many other similar examples – the answer is, there is no
difference between these words in this context; they are
intended to mean the same things (often, relative
intensities of perceptions). Take these words at their plain
meaning. If you find yourself parsing the guidelines like
you’re trying to find a secret message in a song played
backwards, you’re trying too hard.
When we use multiple words to mean similar things, we
are simply trying to be literate, and to use a reasonably
viii BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition
educated vocabulary. We don’t want to be the Language
Police by saying that one synonym is always right and
others are always wrong. So don’t look for inconsistencies
in usage, or try to add nuanced distinctions in different
words used to express the same concept. Don’t require
that words in the style guidelines be the exact same words
used on scoresheets or exams. Worry more about the
concept being conveyed and less about the precise
expression of the concept.
We stylize lists using the Oxford comma, which is a less
ambiguous grammatical construct. When describing lists
of characteristics, or means any or all of the items may be
present, all means all of the items must be present,
either or means only one of the items can be present,
neither nor means none of the items can be present.
Past usage of and/or has been replaced by or, which has
the same logical meaning.
When we use style names in Capital Letters, we are
intending them to be a cross-reference to those styles
within these guidelines. Lowercase usage of style names
represents a more general reference.
Pay careful attention to the modifiers used in style
descriptions. Look for guidance on the magnitude and
quality of each characteristic. Notice that many
characteristics are optional; beers not evidencing these
non-required elements should not be marked down. If an
intensity is used in conjunction with an optional indicator,
that means any intensity from none up to the listed
intensity are allowable, but that the characteristic is not
required.
Phrases such as may have, can contain, might feature, is
acceptable, is appropriate, is typical, optionally, etc. all
indicators of optional elements. Required elements are
generally written as declaratory phrases, or use words
such as must or should. Elements that must not be
present often use phrases such as is inappropriate, no, or
must not. Again, take these words at their plain meaning.
Do not overly focus on single words or phrases within style
descriptions to the exclusion of the broader intent.
Understand the overall impression of the style, the general
balance, and how the style differs from related or similar
styles. Do not disproportionately weight specific phrases if
that would change the overall impression, balance, and
meaning of the style, or if it would cause the beer to be
disqualified or otherwise marked down for style issues.
